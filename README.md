# Reflection fraction

Calculation of the reflection fraction for thick discs with a lamp-post corona

## Some relevant papers

- [A light bending model for the X-ray temporal and spectral properties of accreting black holes](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.349.1435M/abstract) (2004) by Miniutti and Fabian. This paper that shows how the continuum and reflection flux (and hence reflection fraction) change as the corona height changes.
- [Exploring the Effects of Disk Thickness on the Black Hole Reflection Spectrum](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...855..120T/abstract) (2018) by Taylor and Reynolds. This paper shows how the reflection spectrum changes with Eddington fraction / disc thickness.
- [Gradus.jl: spacetime-agnostic general relativistic ray-tracing for X-ray spectral modelling](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.tmp.1668B/abstract) (2025) by Baker and Young. This paper describes the relativistic ray tracing model [Gradus.jl](https://codeberg.org/astro-group/Gradus.jl) that we will use to perform the calculations we need.
