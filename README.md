This paper that shows how the continuum and reflection flux (and hence reflection fraction) change as the corona height changes.
- [Exploring the Effects of Disk Thickness on the Black Hole Reflection Spectrum](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...855..120T/abstract) (2018) by Taylor and Reynolds. This paper shows how the reflection spectrum changes with Eddington fraction / disc thickness.

This paper discusses the technicalities of defining the "reflection fraction".
